This repo contains all literature used for the background section in the thesis paper to be published. This readme will include an annotated list of each read paper. 

## Papers
### Robustness of decentralised learning to nodes and data disruption. 
In my opinion this paper is usefull to refer in the related work section. This paper talks about an extended version of federated learning, fully decentralized learning. This type of learning eliminates the need of a central parameter server that collects and aggregates model parameters. Altough this paper does not the same as what I do in the thesis project (decentralized learning with a parameter server) this is still relevant to relate to to show what other papers are working on.

### Decentralised Learning in Federated Deployment Environments: A System-Level Survey.
This a very relevant paper for taxonomy. I can use it to better back up my baseline configuration of PyTorch, TensorFlow, and the SAM implementation. Furthermore it discusses the concern of privacy instead of fault tolerance. This is an aspect that I dont discuss in the thesis paper, so this might be relevant to refer to in the related works or background section.
